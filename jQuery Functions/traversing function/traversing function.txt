-->  jQuery traversing, which means "move through", are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. Start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.


        ancestors -> parent(), parents(), parentUntil()

        descendants -> children(), find()

        siblings - siblings(), next(), nextAll(), nextUntil(), prev(), prevAll(), prevUntil()

        filter -> first(), last(), eq(), not()
